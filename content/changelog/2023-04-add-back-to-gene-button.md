Previously, users that wanted to go to the corresponding gene page, from a variant page, would scroll down to the "Variant Effect Predictor" section of the variant page, and click on one of the gene links. In cases where many distinct variant pages were open, users expressed interest in a more direct way to go to the gene page.

With this change, a button labeled "Gene" has been added to the header row of a variant page where there is a single canonical transcript. This button allows users to quickly navigate to the gene that the variant falls in. In the rare case where there is no single canonical transcript, there is no gene page button, and users should instead use the Variant Effect Predictor section.

In order to accomodate the extra button, the phrase Single Nucleotide Variant has been abbreviated to SNV on the corresponding variant pages.
