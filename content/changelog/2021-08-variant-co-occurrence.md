Today, we are pleased to announce the incorporation of variant co-occurrence (inferred phasing) information in the gnomAD v2 browser. Phase refers to the genetic relationship between a pair of variants; that is, whether the variants are on the same copy of the gene (*cis*) or on different copies of the gene (*trans*). We are releasing inferred phasing data for all pairs of variants within a gene where both variants have a global allele frequency in gnomAD exomes <5% and are either coding, flanking intronic (from position -1 to -3 in acceptor sites, and +1 to +8 in donor sites) or in the 5’/3’ UTRs. This encompasses 20,921,100 pairs of variants across 19,685 genes. We envision that this data will be of tremendous help to the medical genetics community in identifying and interpreting co-occurring variants in the context of recessive conditions.
