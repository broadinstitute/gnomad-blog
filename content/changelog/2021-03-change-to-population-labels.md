In the population frequencies table for gnomAD v2.1.1 and gnomAD structural variants, we have changed the labels we use to classify individuals by chromosomal sex from "male" and "female" to "XY" and "XX," respectively. More detail on the reason for this change can be found in the [gnomAD v3.1 blog post](/2020-10-gnomad-v3-1-new-content-methods-annotations-and-data-availability/#tweaks-and-updates).
