Previously, performing a search in the Variant table would remove all neighboring rows from view, leaving only the exact search results displayed. This often resulted in a loss of context regarding a variant's position in the table and its surrounding variants.

Now, there is an option to enable the display of nearby variants. When "Display neighboring variants" is selected, users are able to search for specific variants and also look at nearby variants in the table. As users search, the table automatically jumps to the first search result, which is highlighted.
