Previously, performing a search in the Variant table would remove all neighboring rows from view, leaving only the exact search results displayed. This often resulted in a loss of context regarding the a variant's position in the table and its surrounding variants.

Now, there is an option to enable "Display neighboring variants" and when this is checked off, users are still able to search for specific variants but while viewing the surrounding variants in the table. As users search, the table automatically jumps to the first search result, which is highlighted.
