The gene and transcript pages show variants located in or within 75 bases of a coding exon. For genes and transcripts with large coding regions, this can result in data in the tracks being difficult to see when it is condensed into a small area on the screen. Now, you can zoom in on genes and transcripts to focus on data in a specific region.

To zoom in, click the "Zoom in" button above the coverage track. Select a region of the gene or transcript to zoom in on using the start and stop inputs or the slider. When zoomed in, a "mini-map" will display which region of the gene or transcript is currently visible. To view a different region, click "Select different regions" or adjust the slider. To zoom out and see the full gene or transcript, click the "View full gene" or "View full transcript" button.
