# TODO: I picked a random date above; update when we have the actual date

Updated transcript tissue expression and proportion expressed across transcripts (pext) tracks have been added to the gene pages in the gnomAD v4 browser.

<!-- end_excerpt -->

# TODO: update GTEx v10 link when available
The updated tracks in the gnomAD v4 browser were generated using [GTEx v10 data](https://gtexportal.org/home/). 

# TODO: insert image of the new pext tracks with caption "Location of the transcript tissue expression and pext tracks" when demo browser is ready

The previous versions of these tracks, available in the gnomAD v2 browser, were generated using [GTEx v7 data](https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets#filesetFilesDiv64). For more information about the proportion expressed across transcripts (pext) score, including its utility and how it is generated, please see our [help page](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/help/pext).
