Updated transcript tissue expression and proportion expressed across transcripts (pext) tracks have been added to the gene pages in the gnomAD v4 browser.

<!-- end_excerpt -->

The updated tracks in the gnomAD v4 browser were generated using [GTEx v10](https://gtexportal.org/home/home/news?id=530) bulk tissue transcript expression [data](https://storage.googleapis.com/adult-gtex/bulk-gex/v10/rna-seq/GTEx_Analysis_v10_RSEMv1.3.3_transcripts_tpm.txt.gz).

The previous versions of these tracks, available in the gnomAD v2 browser, were generated using [GTEx v7](https://gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/bulk_tissue_expression). For more information about the proportion expressed across transcripts (pext) score, including its utility and how it is generated, please see our [help page](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/help/pext).
