The ClinVar variants track now includes an option to filter by review status. ClinVar assigns a [review status](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/review_status/) to each variant, along with a corresponding number of gold stars, ranging from 0 to 4 stars. 

With the addition of this new feature, users will now find a dropdown filter option within the ClinVar variants track with the following options: **All Stars**, **1+ Stars**, **2+ Stars**, **3+ Stars**, **4 Stars**.
