The ClinVar variants track now includes an option to filter by review status. ClinVar assigns a [review status](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/review_status/) to each variant, along with a corresponding number of gold stars, ranging from 0 to 4 stars. 

Users will now be able to filter ClinVar variants based on review status by selecting one of the following options from a dropdown: **0-4 Stars**, **>=1 Stars**, **>=2 Stars**, **>=3 Stars**, **4 Stars**.
