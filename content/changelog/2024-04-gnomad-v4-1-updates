This changelog entry discusses additional smaller updates to gnomAD added with the v4.1 release that were not discussed in the [blog post](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/news/2024-04-gnomad-v4-1/).

<!-- end_excerpt -->

As part of gnomAD v4.1, we have added the following new features:
- Browser display of non-UK Biobank (UKB) subset of gnomAD v4 exomes
- Supplementary files containing REVEL scores for variants in 2,414 transcripts that weren't scored in the v4.0 release
- New joint exome + genome frequency resources with statistical tests flagging variants with [discrepant frequencies](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/help/combined-freq-stats)

We have also updated the following features:
- Gene constraint metrics
- Exome copy number variants
- Genome structural variants
- [Stats page](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/stats)

### Browser display of non-UK Biobank subset
As part of gnomAD v4.1, we have exposed the non-UK Biobank (UKB) subset of the gnomAD v4 exomes. This subset was previously only available in our downloadable files but is now available in the ["Dataset"](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/help/dataset-selection) toggle on gene, transcript, region, and variant pages.

Example [variant](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-55051215-G-GA?dataset=gnomad_r4_non_ukb):
