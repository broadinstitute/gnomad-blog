Previously, the reference genome build for a particular dataset was only displayed after selection. This led to confusion with differing results between GRCh37 and GRCh38. 

Now, when selecting a version or dataset, the genome reference build is now visible. This informs users what build they are searching on before selecting a version or dataset.
