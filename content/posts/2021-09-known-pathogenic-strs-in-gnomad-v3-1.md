### Overview

We have generated short tandem repeat (STR) calls for 59 disease associated loci by running ExpansionHunter [[Dolzhenko 2019](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/22/4754/5499079)] on 19,241 whole genome samples from gnomAD v3.1.Â 

This release includes:

* Distributions of STR genotypes in the general population, with subsets by ancestry group and sex
* Visualizations of the read data for all samples at all 59 loci
* Collected reference information including disease associations and inheritance modes
* [Downloadable variant catalogs](https://github.com/broadinstitute/str-analysis/tree/main/str_analysis/variant_catalogs) for running ExpansionHunter on these 59 loci for either GRCh38 or GRCh37, with or without off-target regions.
* A specialized approach for calling loci such as RFC1 where the pathogenic motif(s) differ from the motif in the reference genome
* Downloadable data underlying the displayed distributions, as well as additional results not displayed in the browser - such as genotypes called using off-target regions [**TODO link**]

### Acknowledgments

We thank Stephanie DiTroia, Grace VanNoy, and Nehir Kurtas for reviewing the list of known pathogenic loci and evaluating disease associations; Egor Dolzhenko for consultations on various topics related to ExpansionHunter, REViewer, and STRs; Depienne et al. and Halman et al. authors for the very helpful resources; Yossi Farjoun for mentorship during the initial stages of the project; Jackie Goldstein, Daniel King, Cotton Seed and the rest of the hail team for building Hail Batch and other tools that made it much easier to generate this callset.
